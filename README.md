# Timesheet

Small script to keep track of project estimates.

In data.csv each line is in the form `task_name,estimate,time_taken_so_far`.

Start the script, choose a task and then tell it when you're finished / want to change task.

Idea is to log estimate vs actual time for small chunks of work and then review this to see how I can improve estimates in future.
